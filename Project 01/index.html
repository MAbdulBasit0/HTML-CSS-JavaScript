              <b>Abdul Qadeer Khan was a Pakistani scientist.</b> He played a
              pivotal role in nuclear weapons program development in Pakistan
              and abroad. His efforts to develop nuclear weapons through the
              enrichment of uranium and not plutonium allowed Pakistan to
              successfully develop weapons, which it had struggled to do
              previously.

            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Abdul Qadeer Khan (A.Q. Kahn) was born on April 1, 1936, in
                Bhopal, India. As a Muslim, Khan immigrated to Pakistan in 1952.
              </li>
              <li>
                He then began working at Physical Dynamics Research Laboratory,
                a subcontractor of the Dutch partner of URENCO.
              </li>
              <li>
                After learning of India's 'Smiling Buddha' nuclear test in 1974,
                Khan joined his nation's clandestine efforts to develop atomic
                weapons.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the early 1980s Pakistan acquired from China the blueprints
                of a nuclear weapon that used a uranium implosion design that
                the Chinese had successfully tested in 1966
              </li>
              <li>
                Starting in the mid-1980s, Kahn began to create front companies
                through which he covertly sell or traded centrifuges,
                components, designs, and expertise in an extensive black-market
                network
              </li>
              <li>
                On January 31, 2004, Khan was arrested for transferring nuclear
                technology to other countries.
              </li>
              <li>
                On October 10, 2021, Khan died at the age of 85 in Islamabad
                after being transferred to a hospital after he tested positive
                for COVID-19 in August. He was given a state funeral at the
                Faisal Mosque before being buried at the H-8 graveyard in
                Islamabad.
